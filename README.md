# Selection Sort Algorithm

Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(N^2) as there are two nested loops.

## Advantages
1. Simple and easy to understand.
2. Works well with small datasets.

## Disadvantages
1. Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average case.
2. Does not work well on large datasets.
3. Does not preserve the relative order of items with equal keys, which means it is not stable.
